#1 Introduction 

Task of this assignment was to demonstrate the ability to use R as vector GIS. Therefore basic programming- and spatial-concepts, of GIScience where applied. This assignments covers the operational use of geo-web-scraping, geoprocessing (topology, geocoding,distance weighting etc.) as well as the application of different TSP (traveling salesman problem) algorithmns and a correspondending routing to the best TSP tour. These functions were used to retrieve and locate all german REWE stores (german supermarket franchise), as well as to find the best routing between a subset of at least 15 stores within a postcode-area (and the next order neighbors).

## Your Familiar Tools

Feel free to use the `knitr` infrastructure with dozens of tunable options in
your document.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000
x1  <- matrix(rnorm(n), ncol = 2)
x2  <- matrix(rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1.5), ncol = 2)
x   <- rbind(x1, x2)
head(x)
smoothScatter(x, xlab = "x1", ylab = "x2")
```

You can include code snippets of languages other than R, but note that
the block header has no curly brackets around the language name.

```cpp
// [[Rcpp::export]]
NumericVector timesTwo(NumericVector x) {
    return x * 2;
}
```

You can also write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$,
footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(iris, 10))
```
